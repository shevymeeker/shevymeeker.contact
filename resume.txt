Package Sort Supervisor
Oct 2013 - April 2018
UPS · Owensboro, KY
Ran high-capacity local sort operations: accurate scanning, sorting, tagging, and safe loading using retractable conveyor systems. Roughly half of nightly volume was smalls, packages smaller than a shoebox that had to be sorted separately, scanned into one of 40 specific locations, and bagged. On Saturdays, manually planned driver routes to meet time-sensitive air delivery and pickup windows. Consistently met all KPIs including scan percentage, OTR departure times, and man-hours per package count. Completed weekly and monthly training worksheets within sort time, not as additional hours, without using them as justification for a late trailer. Served as a trained hazmat responder for package incidents and spill containment.
